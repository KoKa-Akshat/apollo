Apollo: Probability & Markov Chains Roadmap

A long-term, code-first journey to master probability, Markov chains, Monte Carlo/MCMC, HMMs, and quant workflows. The repo pairs Harvard Stat110 (Blitzstein–Hwang) with daily simulations, proofs-by-experiment, and portfolio-ready mini-projects (PageRank, HMM regimes, Monte-Carlo option pricing, backtests).

What’s inside

notebooks/ — reproducible labs (LLN/CLT, conditional expectation, importance sampling, Markov chains, PageRank, HMMs, ARIMA/GARCH, Monte Carlo).

src/ — small, tested utilities (simulation harnesses, Markov tools, PageRank, HMM helpers, data loaders).

tests/ — PyTest checks (simulation sanity, PageRank convergence, EM monotonicity, data integrity).

reports/ — weekly write-ups and Quarto site (figures, conclusions, “what failed/why”).

data/ — cached inputs (ignored by Git).
