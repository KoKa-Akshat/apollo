A long-term, code-first journey to master probability, Markov chains, Monte Carlo/MCMC, HMMs, and quant workflows. The repo pairs Harvard Stat110 (Blitzsteinâ€“Hwang) with daily simulations, proofs-by-experiment, and portfolio-ready mini-projects (PageRank, HMM regimes, Monte-Carlo option pricing, backtests).
